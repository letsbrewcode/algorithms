# Purpose of this file is to practice calculating
# time and space complexity of basic algorithms.
# Calculate time complexity of following functions.
# NOTE - This code may not be syntactically correct
# . Its only for mathematical calculations and is
# not expected to be run.

#Example 1
def func(n):
    for x in range(n):
        k = 2

    k = 1000

# Example 2
def func(n):
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(x):
            k = x * y

    for z in range(n):
        k = z
    
    k = 3.14

# Example 3
def func(n):
    k = 100000
    for x in range(k):
        result = log(x)
        n = n + 1
