# Determine the time complexity of following algorithms
# Purpose of this file is to practice calculating
# time and space complexity of basic algorithms.
# NOTE - This code may not be syntactically correct
# . Its only for mathematical calculations and is
# not expected to be run.

# Example 1
def func(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            z = 2 * 2

# Example 2
def func(n):
    for i in range(n):
        z = 2 * 2

# Example 3
def func(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                z = 2 * 2

# Example 4
def func(n):
    i = n
    while i > 0:
        z = 2 * 2
        i = i // 2

# Example 5
def func(n):
    for i in range(n):
        z = 2 * 2
    for j in range(n):
        z = 2 * 2
    for k in range(n):
        z = 2 * 2

# Example 6
def func(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            z = i * i
            y = j * j

    for k in range(n):
        x = k * k + 45
